1. I think I need two tables. One name topics and one name lesson_topics to associate the lesson and topics.
2. For the topic table I need the id and the name of the topic. For the lesson_topics table I would have the lesson id and the topic id. 
3. I don't think any additional data is needed.
4. 
topics
- id: int
- name: string
lesson_topics
- id: int
- lesson_id: reference
- topic_id: reference
5. 
bin/rails generate migration create_topics
bin/rails generate migration create_lesson_topics
